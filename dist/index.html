                            <p>Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind.
                                The
                                truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.</p>
                            <p>They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health
                                to
                                our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”
                            </p>
                            <p>If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power
                                of
                                thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including
                                our
                                financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as
                                thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?</p>
                            <p>We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
                                Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking.
                                Mastering
                                this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it
                                consistently.</p>

                            <p>Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                                prosperity into your life:</p>

                            <p>Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to
                                express
                                heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of
                                these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on
                                abundance, not lack.</p>

                            <p>Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
                                statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and
                                repeat
                                them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your
                                subconscious
                                mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.</p>

                            <p>Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish
                                to
                                achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same
                                way
                                affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually
                                these
                                subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous,
                                and
                                you will become so.</p>

                            <p>Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be
                                one
                                of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell
                                yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you
                                will
                                gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you
                                believe
                                you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are
                                highly
                                successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.</p>

                            <p>Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like.
                                Even
                                if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin
                                to
                                build up and attract more money.</p>

                            <p> Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such
                                that
                                we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
                                will
                                create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?</p>

                            <p>Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day.
                                But
                                over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want.
                                Once
                                you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of
                                recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.</p>

                            <p>Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party.
                                Both
                                walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and
                                unnoticed
                                as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side
                                because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet
                                acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to
                                model
                                your business after?</p>

                            <p>Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know
                                it
                                or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
                                competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront
                                of
                                your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the
                                go-to
                                people.</p>

                            <p>Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping
                                it
                                there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
                                Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded
                                of
                                both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a
                                catch
                                phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are
                                absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this
                                type
                                of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is
                                quite
                                high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their
                                appeal.
                                In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential
                                customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your
                                customers.</p>

                            <p>There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target
                                market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
                                seen by them.</p>

                            <p>Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from
                                my
                                competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
                                yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a
                                crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
                                saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
                                budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap
                                during
                                the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may
                                give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your
                                clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard
                                anything about them for so long.</p>

                            <p>Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for
                                the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology
                                coming
                                down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are
                                becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing
                                of
                                the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage
                                with
                                computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass
                                by
                                without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in
                                the
                                door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to
                                cost
                                you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you have
                                successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.</p>

                            <div class="text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are...
                                searching
                                for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once
                                and
                                they
                                are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
                                to
                                resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                                traffic
                                won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just
                                take
                                one
                                day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again
                                for
                                at
                                least 6 months.
                                2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it.
                                Where
                                do
                                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only
                                downside
                                to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find
                                which
                                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the
                                others
                                out.
                                So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later
                                on
                                when
                                you get the hang of things.
                                3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product
                                or
                                service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell
                                readers
                                about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or service. This is
                                also
                                an
                                excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of
                                webmasters
                                out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they
                                post
                                yours,
                                that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.
                                4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your
                                site.
                                Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just
                                enter
                                the
                                URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and
                                your
                                done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.
                                5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you
                                sign
                                up
                                on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for
                                topics
                                that
                                you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                                you
                                will
                                get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
                                answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because
                                once
                                you
                                make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually,
                                but
                                someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many
                                people
                                who do.
                                6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free,
                                but
                                definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts
                                that
                                they
                                received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend
                                the
                                time
                                surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look into a
                                program
                                that
                                lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and
                                they
                                are
                                free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your
                                surfing in
                                at
                                once.
                                7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of
                                business.
                                You
                                can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something
                                fresh
                                to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all
                                the
                                time.
                                Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours. In
                                other
                                words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving
                                cream.

                            <div class="text">There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                                Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the
                                text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s product
                                pages
                                all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new customers and
                                sales.

                                However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper
                                you
                                will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to
                                your
                                potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more
                                product
                                they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper choices you
                                have to
                                print your catalog on.

                                First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
                                catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.

                                Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog.
                                Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can
                                still
                                display your products well.

                                So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will
                                my
                                cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

                                Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of
                                the
                                paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb
                                uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen
                                for
                                80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured
                                by
                                thickness or “points”.

                                Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you
                                can
                                choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive
                                paper
                                to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive product.

                                There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be
                                printed
                                on. Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.

                                If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can
                                choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your
                                catalog. If
                                your printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into
                                the
                                paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.

                                If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                                quality
                                papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital printing.

                                It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of
                                paper
                                is available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better idea of
                                which
                                one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to suggest the
                                different
                                types of paper they think will be the best for your catalog.

                                Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for you
                                to
                                choose from or may be able to order for you.

                                Dull Coated Paper

                                Matte Coated Paper

                                Glossy Coated Paper

                                Antique Paper

                                Vellum Paper

                                Wove Paper

                                Smooth Paper

                                Felt Paper

                                Linen Paper

                                Fiber-added Paper

                                Laid Paper

                                Parchment

                                Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and
                                ppi.
                                (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It
                                affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is how
                                much
                                your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your text
                                and
                                images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your customer is
                                trying
                                to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also how your images will
                                look.
                                The lower grade finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes sharpen
                                the
                                look of your images.

                                Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for
                                printing your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know what
                                your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.

                            <div class="text">There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                                Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the
                                text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s product
                                pages
                                all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new customers and
                                sales.

                                However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper
                                you
                                will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to
                                your
                                potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the more
                                product
                                they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper choices you
                                have to
                                print your catalog on.

                                First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
                                catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.

                                Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog.
                                Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can
                                still
                                display your products well.

                                So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will
                                my
                                cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

                                Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of
                                the
                                paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb
                                uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen
                                for
                                80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured
                                by
                                thickness or “points”.

                                Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you
                                can
                                choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive
                                paper

                                There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be

                            <div class="text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are...
                                searching
                                for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once
                                and
                                they
                                are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
                                to
                                resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad news is most of your
                                traffic
                                won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out there. Just
                                take
                                one
                                day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to do it again
                                for
                                at
                                least 6 months.
                                2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it.
                                Where
                                do
                                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only
                                downside
                                to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find
                                which
                                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on them and weed the
                                others
                                out.
                                So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later
                                on
                                when
                                you get the hang of things.
                                3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product
                                or
                                service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell
                                readers
                                about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or service. This is
                                also
                                an
                                excellent way to get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of
                                webmasters
                                out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their site. If they
                                post
                                yours,
                                that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.
                                4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your
                                site.
                                Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just
                                enter
                                the
                                URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and
                                your
                                done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.
                                5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you
                                sign
                                up
                                on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for
                                topics
                                that
                                you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                                you
                                will
                                get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and
                                answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because
                                once
                                you
                                make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually,
                                but
                                someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many
                                people
                                who do.
                                6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free,
                                but
                                definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts
                                that
                                they
                                received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend
                                the
                                time
                                surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look into a
                                program
                                that
                                lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There are others and
                                they
                                are
                                free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your
                                surfing in
                                at
                                once.
                                7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of
                                business.
                                You
                                can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something
                                fresh
                                to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they see the same message all
                                the
                                time.
                                Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours. In
                                other
                                words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are advertising shaving
                                cream.
